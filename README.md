# FEEDME
---

I built this silly project not only to work with some libraries for RSS feed, but to actually do something about the uglyness of relying on social media to learn about things that I care.

This project is not meant to serve the public, it might as well just be a script for me or someone else, but I think this is good to hook as a service into a raspberry and have a feed available on demand.

To run this project all that's needed is to execute FastAPI and call the only endpoint available: `/feeds`.
